# We are thrilled to announce that Trieve is being acquired by Mintlify! ðŸŽ‰

We started Trieve with a mission: to make it easy for developers to build AI applications that can retrieve and reason over large amounts of data. Our inspiration came from the challenges we faced in building relevancy-optimized retrieval for our first product, a tool for litigation attorneys.

We are incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. The numbers speak for themselves: over 150M search queries, 2.6M AI conversations, and a community of over 5,400 active users.

Mintlify was one of Trieve's earliest adopters, and we have always been impressed with the quality of their documentation. Their search experience, powered by our technology, set a standard for excellence.

Mintlify's vision extends our own. They are dedicated to empowering builders, and we are excited to contribute to that mission. Denzell and I will be joining the Mintlify team to continue creating powerful tools for developers.

## What does this mean for existing Trieve users?

The Trieve Cloud service will be sunset on November 1st, 2025. We are committed to supporting our users through this transition and will assist them in migrating to other platforms or to a self-hosted version of Trieve. All data will be exportable via the API, and we will be available to assist throughout the migration process.

The open-source Trieve infrastructure will continue to be available and maintained. We will carry on managing the codebase and welcome contributions from the community.

For any questions or assistance, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/a9CGxRuwGv) or email us at [support@trieve.com](mailto:support@trieve.com).

## Open Source Considerations

From the outset, we were committed to ensuring that Trieve could operate without reliance on third-party services. Our goal was to create a sustainable open-source project that would remain accessible and usable, independent of the commercial entity behind it.

While Trieve was a commercial endeavor, we chose the Business Source License (BSL) to protect our users from sudden, restrictive license changes. As part of this acquisition, we are moving to the MIT license to fully embrace the open-source model, ensuring the code can be used by anyone for any purpose.

The repository is available at [github.com/devflowinc/trieve](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve), and we encourage contributions and the involvement of new maintainers from the community.

## Looking Forward

We are excited about the future and the opportunity to build great things at Mintlify. Please do not hesitate to reach out with questions or for assistance with the migration. Our priority is to ensure a smooth transition for all users.

Mintlify is hiring! If you are interested in joining us, please visit their [careers page](https://mintlify.com/careers).

So long, and thanks for all the searches! ðŸš€
