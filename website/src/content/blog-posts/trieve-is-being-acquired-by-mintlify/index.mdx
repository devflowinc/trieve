# We are thrilled to announce that trieve is being acquired by Mintlify! ðŸŽ‰

Denzell and I started Trieve after being annoyed at how long it took to build relevancy optimized retrieval into our first product, a tool for litigation attorneys. Our mission was to make it easy for developers to build AI applications that can retrieve and reason over large amounts of data.

We built everything we could in pursuit of that vision and I'm extremely proud of what we accomplished. The numbers speak for themselves: over 150M search queries, 2.6M AI conversations, and a community of 5,400+ active users.

Lots of those queries came from Mintlify documentation sites! They were one of the earliest adopters of trieve, and we were always happy to stumble upon a documentation site powere by them since we knew the search experience would be great.

Mintlify take's our vision even further. They strieve to empower builders generally and that is something we are excited to be a part of. Denzell and I will be joining and working on the Mintlify team to continue empowering developers to build amazing applications.

## What does this mean for existing trieve users?

Trieve cloud is going to be sunsetted on November 1st, 2025. We will be working with our users to help them migrate to other platforms or [self-host Trieve](https://docs.trieve.ai/self-hosting/azure) if they choose to do so. All data is going to be exportable using the API and we will provide assistance to help with the migration process.

Trieve the open source infrastructure will live on and be usable by anyone who wishes to do so. We will continue to maintain the open source codebase and accept contributions from the community.

Please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/a9CGxRuwGv) or send an email to [support@trieve.com](mailto:support@trieve.com) if you have any questions or need assistance.

## Open Source Considerations

Denzell and I were always committed to making sure that Trieve required 0 third party services to run. We wanted to make sure that the code wouldn't rot and continue to be usable by anyone who so desired whether or not the commercial company behind it was still around.

However, while being something we built to build shareholder value and a company, we kept the licensing as BSL to ensure we would never have to rug pull our users and change the license to be more restrictive. Now that we aer being acquired, we are going to be changing the license to MIT to ensure that it is clear that the code is open source and can be used by anyone for any purpose.

You can find it at [github.com/devflowinc/trieve](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve) and we welcome contributions or even new maintainers from the community.

## Looking Forward

We are excited to build great things at Mintlify and continue to empower developers to build amazing applications.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with the migration process. We are here to help and want to make sure that the transition is as smooth as possible for everyone.

Lastly, Mintlify is hiring! If you are interested in working with us, please check out their [careers page](https://mintlify.com/careers) and apply. We would love to work with you!

So long and thanks for all the searches! ðŸš€
