# Web Pixel Extension

Web pixel app extensions provide developers with a simplified process for managing and processing behavioral data, by loading pixels in a secure sandbox environment with APIs for subscribing to customer events. Web pixel app extensions provide the following benefits to app users and developers:

- Eliminate or minimize the need for users to add tracking code
- Securely access all surfaces, like storefront, checkout and post-purchase pages
- Control what data the developers have access to
- Avoid performance and privacy alerts
- Provide a smaller pixel code library with the removal of excess DOM manipulation code

To learn more about web pixels, see Shopifyâ€™s [developer documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/marketing/pixels/getting-started).

## API

> The web pixel extension API gives you access to a select set of controlled APIs for accessing browser APIs and subscribing to customer events, within one of our Lax or Strict sandboxes.

This template project already provides a basic extension setup. For more information, see the [Web pixel extension API documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/pixels/pixel-extension).

## Customer Events

> Customer events represent and describe the behavior of your customers, including key events during the customer journey, such as page views, product views, cart updates, searches, and purchases.

See all available events in the [Customer Events API documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/pixels/customer-events).
