# We love Open Source Contributors!

Seriously, we are really nice. If you put a PR and it is incorrect, we will likely fix it and merge it instead of closing. We try to make our repository a great place to start your open source contribution journey.

## How to Contribute

1. Find an open issue from the [issues tab](https://github.com/devflowinc/trieve/issues) that suits you
2. Ask to be assigned to the issue and also ask any questions which you feel will help you work on it
3. Fork the repository
4. Add code that meets the requirements to close the open issue
5. Open a PR and wait for review

## Community channels
